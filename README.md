* This is **a team project for Software Engineering (SE) students from NUS**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _UniLink_) used for managing contact details of a University student.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `UniLink` because we want to link University Students up to enjoy a better student life! :3
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[UniLink Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the **[SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see **[se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu)** for more info.
